<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>When diagnosing anomalous behavior on a network, a system administrator has two separate areas to focus on: the packets
traveling over the network (i.e., the network view), and the information contained on the individual hosts connected to the network
(i.e., the host view). The network view provides a glimpse into the overall communication activity of the network, but it does not
reveal what processes are causing this activity. On the other hand, the host view contains details on the processes producing the
network traffic, but it does not contain information on which packets are associated with which process. This inability to
correlate packets with their associated process is a fundamental (although intentional) shortcoming of the modern network stack. To
bridge this gap we introduce the Hone (Host-network) correlator, an open-source tool that correlates packets to processes to
diagnose problems seen on a network.</p>

<p>While the idea of correlating packets to processes is a simple one, the implementation requires kernel modifications that alter
the way the network stack works. While there have been several tools that can do a form of the packet-process correlation approach
taken here, they differ from Hone in fundamental ways. Discussions of these tools and their differences from Hone can be found
in:</p>

<blockquote>FINK, G., DUGGIRALA, V., CORREA, R., AND NORTH, C. Bridging the host-network divide: survey, taxonomy, and solution. In
Proceedings of the 20th Large Installation System Administration Conference (2006), pp. 247-262.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="HowItWorks"></a>How It Works</h3>

<p>The Host-Network (Hone) Packet-Process Correlator for Windows consists of a kernel-mode driver that performs packet-process
correlation and user-mode utilities for reading data collected by the driver and managing the driver. Hone consists of the
following components:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A kernel-mode driver, <tt>hone.sys</tt>, that collects the following network and process data from the system in an <a
		href="https://github.com/HoneProject/Linux-Sensor/wiki/Augmented-PCAP-Next-Generation-Dump-File-Format">augmented PCAP-NG</a>
		format:
		<ul>
			<li>Process start and end events</li>
			<li>Network connection open and close events</li>
			<li>Inbound and outbound packet headers and data, correlated with the process sending or receiving the packet</li>
		</ul>
		For more detailed information on the sensor's functionality, see the <a
		href="https://github.com/HoneProject/Linux-Sensor/wiki/Hone-sensor-requirements-tiers">Sensor Requirements Tiers</a>. The
		Windows sensor is compatible with Tier 4 of these requirements, with the exceptions noted under <a href="#Issues">Known
		Issues</a>.</li>
	<li>A management utility, <tt>honeutil</tt>, that provides additional functionality required by the kernel-mode driver:
		<ul>
			<li>Reading data collected by the driver as PCAP-NG blocks and writing the blocks to files that can be read by other tools
				such as Wireshark</li>
			<li>Reporting driver statistics</li>
			<li>Installation and removal of the network filters used by the driver</li>
			<li>Sending a list of previously opened connections to the driver</li>
		</ul>
</ul>

<p>Similar functionality is also available for Linux using the <a href="https://github.com/HoneProject/Linux-Sensor">Hone)
Packet-Process Correlator for Linux</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name="SystemRequirements"></a>System Requirements</h2>

<p>The minimum system requirements for running Hone are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 and later</li>
	<li>32-bit or 64-bit x86 processor</li>
	<li>Wired or wireless networking</li>
	<li>Sufficient free drive space for saving data collected by the driver (up to several GB)</li>
</ul>

<p>Requirements may be higher for systems used to build Hone.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name="Building"></a>Building</h2>

<p>The following software must be installed in order to build Hone:</p>

<dl>
	<dt><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11800">Windows Driver Kit (WDK) v7.1.0.7600</a></dt>
	<dd>Used to build the kernel-mode driver and user-mode program</dd>

	<dt><a href="http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads">Python 2.7</a></dt>
	<dd>Used to run the build script</dd>

	<dt><a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">Inno Setup 5.5</a></dt>
	<dd>Used to create the installer executable</dd>
</dl>

<p>Prior to building Hone, you need a digital certificate to sign the driver files. For a test environment, you can create a
self-signed certificate, but for a production environment, you will need a valid signing certificate. To create a self-signed
certificate using <tt>makecert</tt> and <tt>pvk2pfx</tt> from the WDK, run the following commands:</p>

<pre>
	makecert -r -pe -n "CN=My CA" -a sha1 -cy authority -sky signature -sv MyCA.pvk MyCA.cer
	makecert -pe -n "CN=My SPC" -a sha1 -cy end -sky signature -ic MyCA.cer -iv MyCA.pvk -sv MySPC.pvk MySPC.cer
	pvk2pfx -pvk MySPC.pvk -spc MySPC.cer -pfx Hone.pfx -po changeit</pre>

<p>When <tt>makecert</tt> prompts for a password, leave the password fields blank and click <tt>OK</tt>. When it asks if you want
to continue without password protection, click <tt>Yes</tt>. When the commands finish, copy <tt>Hone.pfx</tt> into the
<tt>installer</tt> directory.</p>

<p>To build the Hone installer, open a command window with Administrator privileges, change to the directory that contains the Hone
source code, and run the following command:</p>

<pre>
	build.py -v VERSION -c CERT_FILE</pre>

Where <i>VERSION</i> is the version number to use for the build and <i>CERT_FILE</i> is the digital certificate to use to sign the
driver files. <i>Do not</i> run the script from a WDK build environment, since the script automatically sets the build environment
as needed. The script will build Hone for 32-bit and 64-bit platforms. To get help for the various build options, run:

<pre>
	build.py -h</pre>


<p>The build script places the files in the <tt>hone_<i>VERSION</i>_debug</tt> or <tt>hone_<i>VERSION</i>_release</tt> directory,
depending on whether you perform as debug or release build, where <i>VERSION</i> is the version number passed to the build script.
The script will use Inno Setup to create an installer, and, if successful, it will place an installer executable named
<tt>Hone-<i>VERSION</i>-win7.exe</tt> in the <tt>installers</tt> subdirectory. It will also place the debugging symbols in the
<tt>debug_symbols</tt> subdirectory.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name="Installing"></a>Installing</h2>

<p>To install Hone, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p><i>Enable test-signing mode:</i> If you use a self-signed certificate to sign the driver, you will need to enable
		test-signing mode. To enable test-signing mode, open an Administrator command prompt and run:</p>

<pre>
	bcdedit -set TESTSIGNING ON</pre>

		<p><b>WARNING: In test-signing mode, the system will allow the installation of any signed driver, including other drivers
		signed using a &ldquo;self-signed&rdquo; certificate.</b></p>

		<p>After enabling test-signing mode, reboot the system. After the system boots, you should see the words &ldquo;Test
		Mode&rdquo; in the lower right corner of the screen.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>Run the installer:</i> Double-click on the installer file to run the installer, and follow the prompts.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>Accept the license agreement:</i> Check the box to indicate that you accept the terms of the license agreement.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>Start the install:</i> Click the Install button to start the installation. Depending on the user and system settings,
		the system may show a User Account Control (UAC) prompt, or it may prompt you to enter the password for a user with
		Administrator access.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>Wait while the software installs:</i> The installer will take a few minutes to copy the files and finish the
		installation. It will copy the kernel-mode driver to <tt>%SystemRoot%\System32\drivers</tt> and the management utility to
		<tt>%ProgramFiles%\PNNL\Hone</tt>.

		<p>The installer will automatically run the management utility with the <tt>-i</tt> option to install the filters that the
		driver uses. The filters must be installed for the driver to operate properly. Since the driver cannot install the filters on
		its own during system boot, it relies on the management utility to install the filters ahead of time.</p></li>

	<li><p><i>Finish the install:</i> Once the install finishes, the Hone driver will be installed and the software will be ready to
		use.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2><a name="Uninstalling"></a>Uninstalling</h2>

<p>To uninstall Hone, click <tt>Start</tt> &rarr; <tt>All Programs</tt> &rarr; <tt>PNNL</tt> &rarr; <tt>Hone</tt> &rarr;
<tt>Uninstall Hone</tt> or <tt>Programs and Features</tt> in the Control Panel.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name="Using"></a>Using</h2>

<p>The Hone driver should automatically start during the installation process, as well as whenever the system boots. However, the
driver only collects data when a reader is attached to it. To read the data collected by the driver, click <tt>Start</tt> &rarr;
<tt>All Programs</tt> &rarr; <tt>PNNL</tt> &rarr; <tt>Hone</tt> &rarr; <tt>Hone Reader</tt>. You can also open a Hone command
prompt by clicking <tt>Start</tt> &rarr; <tt>All Programs</tt> &rarr; <tt>PNNL</tt> &rarr; <tt>Hone</tt> &rarr; <tt>Hone Command
Prompt</tt> and running the following command:</p>

<pre>
	honeutil read</pre>

<p>The reader will save the data in <a
href="https://github.com/HoneProject/Linux-Sensor/wiki/Augmented-PCAP-Next-Generation-Dump-File-Format">augmented PCAP-NG</a>
formatted files that can be read by tools such as Wireshark. To see the additional fields in the augmented PCAP-NG files, you will
need a <a href="https://github.com/HoneProject/Wireshark-Shim/wiki/Hone-Enhanced-Wireshark">Hone-enabled version of Wireshark.</a>
There is also a <a href="https://github.com/HoneProject/Wireshark-Shim">Wireshark shim</a> available for viewing Hone data in
near-real-time using the Hone-enabled version of Wireshark.</p>

<p>If you press <tt>CTRL-BREAK</tt>, the utility will close the current file and open a new one, and if you press <tt>CTRL-C</tt>,
the utility will close the current file and exit. If you specify the <tt>-v</tt> option when starting the utility, it will print
more verbose status messages.</p>

<h3><a name="ControllingTheDriverService"></a>Controlling the Driver Service</h3>

<p>In some cases, you may wish to suspend collection of data by the Hone driver, or you may wish to restart the driver service. The
following table lists the commands used to control the Hone driver service. Note that the driver service will not stop while there
are readers attached to the driver.</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
	<tr><th>    Command           </th><th>Description                 </th></tr>
	<tr><td><tt>sc stop hone </tt></td><td>Stop the Hone driver        </td></tr>
	<tr><td><tt>sc start hone</tt></td><td>Start the Hone driver       </td></tr>
	<tr><td><tt>sc query hone</tt></td><td>Query the Hone driver status</td></tr>
</table>

<h3><a name="ManagingTheDriver"></a>Managing the Driver</h3>

<p>The Hone management utility, <tt>honeutil</tt>, provides additional
functionality required by the kernel-mode driver. You can run <tt>honeutil
-h</tt> to get detailed help for the management utility.</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
	<tr><th>    Command                 </th><th>Description                                     </th></tr>
	<tr><td><tt>honeutil read      </tt></td><td>Read data collected by the Hone driver          </td></tr>
	<tr><td><tt>honeutil send-conns</tt></td><td>Send list of open connections to the Hone driver</td></tr>
	<tr><td><tt>honeutil get-stats </tt></td><td>Get statistics from the Hone driver             </td></tr>
	<tr><td><tt>honeutil install   </tt></td><td>Install the Hone driver network filters         </td></tr>
	<tr><td><tt>honeutil uninstall </tt></td><td>Uninstall the Hone driver network filters       </td></tr>
</table>

<p>If you manually stop and start the Hone driver using the commands listed in the previous section, you need to run <tt>honeutil
send-conns</tt> to send the list of currently open connections to the driver. This allows the driver to properly correlate packets
for connections that were opened before the driver started. You do not need to do this in normal operation.</p>

<p>You can also use the management utility to show a report of the current driver statistics, such as the driver version, driver
uptime, number of packets captured, and so on, by running <tt>honeutil get-stats</tt>. There are a couple of things to keep in mind
when viewing this report. First, zero indicates an unlimited snap length (snap length is the maximum amount of packet data the
driver will capture). Second, the number of connection close events may exceed the number of connection open events, since the
operating system can generate multiple events when a connection closes.</p>

<p>The management utility also has two other commands, <tt>install</tt> and <tt>uninstall</tt> that are used to install and
uninstall the network filters used by the Hone driver. The installer uses the management utility to perform these operations when
installing and uninstalling the driver. They should not be needed at other times.</p>

<h3><a name="SettingRingBufferSize"></a>Setting the Driver Ring Buffer Size</h3>

<p>Internally, the Hone driver uses ring buffers to temporarily store the data it collects until the management utility can read
it. The ring buffers use memory from non-paged pool, which may be a scarce resource on some systems. The driver allows
administrators to adjust the amount of memory it uses for these buffers so that administrators on systems with limited amounts of
memory can free up more memory, and administrators on heavily loaded systems can buffer more events. To change the size of the ring
buffers, open a Hone command prompt by clicking <tt>Start</tt> &rarr; <tt>All Programs</tt> &rarr; <tt>PNNL</tt> &rarr;
<tt>Hone</tt> &rarr; <tt>Hone Command Prompt</tt>, and run the following command:</p>

<pre>
	reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\PNNL\Hone" /v RingBufferSize /t REG_DWORD /d <i>SIZE</i></pre>

<p>Note that the driver will continue to use the old ring buffer size for any programs that are currently reading data from the
driver. It will use the new ring buffer size for any new programs that connect to it.</p>

<p>The following tables gives information on the minimum, default, and maximum values for the ring buffer size, as well as the
number of PCAP-NG blocks the driver can store on the ring buffer for 32-bit and 64-bit systems:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
	<tr><th rowspan="2">Setting</th><th rowspan="2">Size</th><th colspan="2">Number of PCAP-NG Blocks</th></tr>
	<tr>                                          <th>32-bit Systems</th><th>64-bit Systems</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Minimum</td><td>1024             </td><td>256           </td><td>128           </td></tr>

<h2><a name="Issues"></a>Known Issues</h2>

<p>The Hone Packet-Process Correlator for Windows is compliant with tiers 1 through 4 of the <a
href="https://github.com/HoneProject/Linux-Sensor/wiki/Hone-sensor-requirements-tiers">Sensor Requirements Tiers</a>, with the
following known issues:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The sensor does not sort the PCAP-NG blocks for running processes and open connections at the beginning of a log file
		properly, so they may not be in strict order by timestamp.</li>

	<li><p>The sensor correlates ICMP packets to the process that is handling the packets, but that process in most cases is the
		SYSTEM process (PID 4). When a program uses the Windows operating system ICMP APIs, such as the <a
		href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366050.aspx">IcmpSendEcho</a> API, a kernel-mode driver is responsible for
		sending and receiving the ICMP packets on behalf of the program. Since all kernel-mode drivers in Windows are hosted by the
		SYSTEM process, the Hone sensor will correlate these ICMP packets to the SYSTEM process. Windows does not provide any mechanism
		to determine which driver in the SYSTEM process is actually sending or receiving the packets.</p>

		<p>If the process bypasses the Windows operating system ICMP APIs and creates its own ICMP packets, the Hone sensor will be
		able to correlate the ICMP packets with the process. However, most processes use the Windows operating system ICMP APIs, so the
		Hone sensor will correlate most ICMP packets to the SYSTEM process.</p></li>

	<li>The sensor does not compute the checksum for outbound ICMP packets after creating the IP header.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2><a name="Debugging"></a>Debugging</h2>

<p>The development team has tested Hone extensively to help ensure the system operates correctly when Hone is running. However, in
the case that an undetected bug in the driver causes the system to crash, don't panic! If the crash occurs during system boot, you
can boot into safe mode and run <tt>sc delete hone</tt> to disable the Hone driver and regain access to your machine. However, it
would be greatly beneficial to the developers if you kindly notify us of such a failure by opening an <a
href="https://github.com/HoneProject/Windows-Sensor/issues">issue</a>.  If possible, please provide the memory dump, which is
usually found in <tt>%SystemRoot%\Minidump\*.DMP</tt> on reboot after a failure.</p>

<h3><a name="ViewingDebuggingOutput"></a>Viewing Debugging Output</h3>

<p>The checked (debug) build of the driver prints several debug messages to help track the flow of execution. You can view these
messages by either running the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896647.aspx">debug view utility</a> in
the system where the Hone driver is installed, or by attaching a debugger to the system.</p>

<p>In order to see the debug messages, you must first enable them. You can either change a value in the registry, or, if you are
using a debugger, run a command from inside the debugger. To change the registry value, open a Hone command prompt by clicking
<tt>Start</tt> &rarr; <tt>All Programs</tt> &rarr; <tt>PNNL</tt> &rarr; <tt>Hone</tt> &rarr; <tt>Hone Command Prompt</tt>, and run
the following command:</p>

<pre>
	reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Debug Print Filter" /v IHVDRIVER /t REG_DWORD /d <i>MASK</i></pre>

<p>You will need to reboot the system after adding the registry key for the changes to take effect. The following table shows which
mask values to use to enable the different debug levels:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
	<tr><th>Message level</th><th>Bit mask</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Error        </td><td>0x01    </td></tr>
	<tr><td>Warning      </td><td>0x02    </td></tr>
	<tr><td>Information  </td><td>0x04    </td></tr>
	<tr><td>Verbose      </td><td>0x08    </td></tr>
	<tr><td>Lock Status  </td><td>0x10    </td></tr>
</table>

<p>For example, to view warning and informational messages while ignoring verbose and lock status message, use a mask of
<tt>0x06</tt>. Note that error messages are always shown, no matter what the mask value is set to.</p>

<p>If you are using a debugger, you can run the following command from inside the debugger to temporarily enable debug messages for
the specified mask:</p>

<pre>
	ed nt!Kd_IHVDRIVER_Mask <i>MASK</i></pre>

<p>If you get an error that the debugger cannot resolve the <tt>nt!Kd_IHVDRIVER_Mask</tt> symbol, make sure that your symbol path
is <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/311503">set correctly</a>, and run the following commands:</p>

<pre>
	.symfix
	.reload /f nt</pre>

<h3><a name="ViewingPoolAllocations"></a>Viewing Pool Allocations</h3>

<p>You can view driver pool allocations using the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff550442.aspx">poolmon</a>
program included in the WDK:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>32-bit:</b> C:\WinDDK\7600.16385.1\tools\Other\amd64\poolmon.exe</li>
	<li><b>64-bit:</b> C:\WinDDK\7600.16385.1\tools\Other\i386\poolmon.exe</li>
</ul>

<p>Copy the appropriate version of <tt>poolmon</tt> to the system where the Hone driver is installed, and run it as follows:</p>

<pre>
	poolmon -iHone -iHoNg -iHoNl -iHoPg -iHoPl -iHoQb -iHoQc -iHoQi -iHoQk -iHoQo -iHoQp -iHoQr -iHoQs -iHoRl</pre>

<p>Start the driver, perform some tests, and stop the driver. If the differences between allocations and frees for a pool tag is
not zero, then the driver is leaking memory. The following table shows how the driver uses each tag:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
<tr><th>Tag </th><th>Component      </th><th>Usage                              </th></tr>

<h2><a name="Development"></a>Development</h2>

The Hone driver consists of four modules:

<ol>
	<li><b>Network monitor:</b> Monitors connection events and captures packet data</li>
	<li><b>Process monitor:</b> Monitors process start and end events</li>
	<li><b>Read interface:</b> Provides read interface for user-mode programs</li>
	<li><b>Queue manager:</b> Provides queues for PCAP-NG blocks collected by other modules</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="NetworkMonitor"></a>Network Monitor</h3>

<p>This module uses the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) to track connections and capture data for incoming and outgoing packets.
It sends these blocks to the queue manager.</p>

<p>This driver relies on WFP support that is only available starting with Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. Even though Windows
Vista and Windows Server 2008 include support for WFP, these versions do not have the WFP callouts needed by the driver. Earlier
version of Windows do not include any support for WFP.</p>

<p>The network monitor registers IPv4 and IPv6 callouts at the following layers to capture connection open and close events:</p>

<ul>
	<li>ALE_AUTH_CONNECT</li>
	<li>ALE_AUTH_RECV_ACCEPT</li>
	<li>ALE_ENDPOINT_CLOSURE</li>
	<li>ALE_RESOURCE_ASSIGNMENT</li>
	<li>ALE_RESOURCE_RELEASE</li>
</ul>

<p>It also registers IPv4 and IPv6 callouts at the following layers to capture packet data:</p>

<ul>
	<li>INBOUND_TRANSPORT</li>
	<li>OUTBOUND_TRANSPORT</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="ProcessMonitor"></a>Process Monitor</h3>

<p>This module tracks process start and exit events. Upon initialization, it gathers information about all currently running
processes. It then tracks whenever processes start, end, or load an image, and it sends these events in PCAP-NG blocks to the queue
manager.</p>

<h3><a name="ReadInterface"></a>Read Interface</h3>

<p>This module provides a read interface for user-mode programs on &ldquo;\\.\HoneOut&rdquo;. The module supports an unlimited
number of simultaneous readers.</p>

<p>The driver also supports a number of IOCTLs to control its behavior:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3">
	<tr><th>IOCTL</th><th>Description</th><th>Input</th><th>Output</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>IOCTL_HONE_MARK_RESTART</td>
		<td>Tells the driver to stop at the end of the next PCAP-NG block. The next read will return a length of 0 to let the user-mode
			program know that it has finished reading a complete block so it can safely close its output file.</td>
		<td>None</td>
		<td>None</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>IOCTL_HONE_FILTER_CONNECTIONS</td>
		<td>Tells the driver to filter all packets for the specified connection IDs. Filtering is done on a per-reader basis, so each
			reader can filter packets for different connection IDs. Since the driver expects a connection ID rather than a socket,
			programs can use the SIO_QUERY_WFP_ALE_ENDPOINT_HANDLE Windows Socket API IOCTL to get the connection ID.</td>
		<td>Array of 32-bit connection IDs</td>
		<td>None</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>IOCTL_HONE_FILTER_PROCESSES</td>
		<td>Tells the driver to filter all packets for the specified process IDs. Filtering is done on a per-reader basis, so each
			reader can filter packets for different process IDs.</td>
		<td>Array of 32-bit process IDs</td>
		<td>None</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>IOCTL_HONE_SET_SNAP_LENGTH</td>
		<td>Sets the number of bytes of packet data that the driver will provide to the user-mode program. If the snap length is set to
			0, the driver will provide all available packet data. For space and processing efficiency, the driver uses the maximum snap
			length for all readers to determine how many bytes to save internally, but it gives each reader the number of bytes that
			reader has specified.</td>
		<td>32-bit snap length</td>
		<td>None</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>IOCTL_HONE_GET_SNAP_LENGTH</td>
		<td>Returns the current snap length for the reader.</td>
		<td>None</td>
		<td>32-bit snap length</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>IOCTL_HONE_SET_DATA_EVENT_32 and IOCTL_HONE_SET_DATA_EVENT_64</td>
		<td><p>Provides an event to the driver that it can set whenever there is data for the user-mode program to read. If there is no
			data available when a program reads from the driver, the driver returns immediately without blocking. If the program does not
			want to poll the driver, it can register an event that the driver will set whenever it enqueues data on an empty reader queue.
			The program then reads until it gets a zero, indicating there is no more data available, and waits on the event. When the
			driver sets the event, the program wakes up and can continue the cycle.</p>

			<p>32-bit programs must use IOCTL_HONE_SET_DATA_EVENT_32 and 64-bit programs must use IOCTL_HONE_SET_DATA_EVENT_64 so the
			driver knows what size to expect for the event handle. 32-bit programs will work properly with the 64-bit driver.</p></td>
		<td>32-bit <i>or</i> 64-bit event handle</td>
		<td>None</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>IOCTL_HONE_SET_OPEN_CONNECTIONS</td>
		<td>Passes a list of currently open connections to the driver. Since the kernel-mode driver does not have access to user-mode
			APIs, it is unable to get the list of currently open connections when it is loaded. This is not a problem if the driver is
			loaded at boot time before any connections are opened, but it can cause the driver to incorrectly correlate packets if the
			driver is loaded after the system boots (for example, when the driver is initially installed).</td>
		<td>A CONNECTIONS structure containing open connection information</td>
		<td>None</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>IOCTL_HONE_GET_STATISTICS</td>
		<td>Gets driver statistics such as driver version, uptime, packets captured, etc.</td>
		<td>None</td>
		<td>A STATISTICS structure containing driver statistics</td>
	</tr>

<h3><a name="QueueManager"></a>Queue Manager</h3>

<p>This module stores PCAP-NG blocks until the user-mode programs can read them. It also tracks connections and processes so it can
perform packet/process correlation and so that it can provide a list open connections and running processes to user-mode programs
when they first connect to the driver.</p>
