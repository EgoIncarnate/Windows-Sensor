Hone is a tool for correlating packets to processes to bridge the HOst-NEtwork
divide. The Hone Packet-Process Correlator for Windows consists of a
kernel-mode driver that performs packet-process correlation and user-mode
utilities for reading data collected by the driver and managing the driver.
For information on building, installing, and using Hone, as well as technical
information about the inner workings of Hone, see the Readme.html file.
